## Library of Stuff that may be helpful in Speech Segmentation & Double Talk Detection

This is just the library of useful classes, functions, parsers, etc., and may be also application backend at some point.

Preferred version of Python is 3.5, may be soon 3.6. Using with Python 2.7 hasn't failed yet though.

For examples of usage in real experiments and experiences, please refer to [rennet-x](https://bitbucket.org/nm-rennet/rennet-x).

Until this library/package does not have a proper `setup.py`, an easy way to use it would be to add the root of the local copy of this repository to your `PYTHONPATH` variable.
Then you will be able to access the stuff in this library as any other Python library's stuff.
Refer to [rennet-x](https://bitbucket.org/nm-rennet/rennet-x) for inspirations.

## NOTE: Things are changing fast. This is not even v1.

It is likely that many things will not be working as is in [rennet-x](https://bitbucket.org/nm-rennet/rennet-x).

That repo, and this, are results of a great divorce, so some things may be unexpectedly broken. Please do shout out if you find something.
Be patient until the APIs are finalized.
